This is a Qt\-Wayland compositor based on the example qwindowcompositor which I am developing in order to explore truly 3\-D windowing, both by bringing 2\-D windows into a 3\-D workspace with the help of an Oculus Rift H\-M\-D and a Razer Hydra 6\-D\-O\-F mouse, and also by providing a mechanism for applications to request a 3\-D interface context in the 3\-D workspace in the same way that a traditional display server allows applications to request a 2\-D interface context in the 2\-D workspace. A set of slides explaining the project are available \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1okL5quA3wzd9oFmWkhbUjWEU89-YJKB3lOPBnHoaE28/edit?usp=sharing}{\tt here}.
