qtwayland-motorcar-compositor
=============================

This is a QtWayland compositor based on the example qwindowcompositor which I am developing in order to explore truly 3D windowing, both by bringing 2D windows into a 3D workspace with the help of an Oculus Rift HMD and a Razer Hydra 6DOF mouse, and also by providing a mechanism for applications to request a 3D interface context in the 3D workspace in the same way that a traditional display server allows applications to request a 2D interface context in the 2D workspace. A set of slides explaining the project are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1okL5quA3wzd9oFmWkhbUjWEU89-YJKB3lOPBnHoaE28/edit?usp=sharing).
