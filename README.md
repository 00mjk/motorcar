=============================

This is a QtWayland compositor based on the example qwindowcompositor which I am developing for my Masters thesis in order to explore truly 3D windowing, both by bringing 2D windows into a 3D workspace with the help of an Oculus Rift HMD and a Razer Hydra 6DOF mouse, and also by providing a mechanism for applications to request a 3D interface context in the 3D workspace in the same way that a traditional display server allows applications to request a 2D interface context in the 2D workspace. A set of slides explaining the project are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1svgGMxxbfmcHy_KuS5Q9hah8PQOsXqvjBKOoMIzW24Y/edit?usp=sharing) and my thesis is available as a PDF [here](https://github.com/evil0sheep/MastersThesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true).
